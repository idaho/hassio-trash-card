## Usage

### Create events in your calendar
In order for the Trash card to display informations, they need to be existing in a calendar. Here's some rules to follow when creating the events in your calendar: 

1. It must be entire day events (only form of events supported at the moment)
2. You must use the same event name for the same method of collection. You'll map them later. Right now, the card support up to 5 different type of collections

![O](https://github.com/idaho/hassio-trash-card/assets/1178/3610465f-0b9a-4ded-8621-9691c845acd3)

1. First, you need to select your calendar entity in the first field `Entity` (can be different because it's translated in your own language). 
2. Then, for all the different collection, you'll have to fill those fiels: 
    a. `Label` is the text you want to be displayed in your card. It can be anything
    b. `Icon` is the icon you can to be used in your card. You can select through the availabla HA icons, and even start typing to search
    c. `Color` is the color you want your card to be. ‚ö†Ô∏è it's not gonna be the color of the icon but of the card itself
    d. `Pattern` is the event title you used when creating events in your calendar. For example, for recycling, mine is "PMC", because that's the event name in my calendar.
3. `day style` is how to display the information. Full date or "in xx days"
4. `drop today events from` is at which hour you want to stop displaying today's collection
5. `next days` is how many days in the future the card will look up. If there is no upcoming event in the next XX days you selected here, **the card will not display at all**.
